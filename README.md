# Introduction

Easy to learn Arabic layout that is phonetically mapped to English QWERTY

## Purpose

It's hard to learn different layouts, get a grasp on a good typing speed for each one. So I developed this easy to learn arabic layout.

## Credits

I took the urdu phonetic keyboard available in kde neon as my template. The layout was developed by @uppaljs (zaeem@linux.net.pk)
